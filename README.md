#Investment Simulator
A proof of concept that comes with a fair bit of infrastrucutre. 
The setup is fairly easy, just pull the repo:

npm install

Run a postgres instance through docker locally, expose a port, singup info, etc

Change all of the environment variables, it has a built in API key so don't worry about that

npm run setup

npm run dev

Feel free to make changes, this project is mainly infrastructure
